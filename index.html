              <p><strong>About me:</strong> My name is Elan. I have lived in Seattle for three years, however before that I was a California native. I am loving my time in the Emerald City. Until recently I was bartending for a small company in West Seattle. I have been a bartender for 10 years. Before that I did computer aided drafting on a contract basis for architectural &amp; engineering firms. I have always enjoyed working on computers and have built a couple for my purposes in the past. I took this class to further my technical capacity and hope to find an entry level coding job with the skills the curriculum is teaching us. I like to hike and see the beautiful PNW, traveling(cheaply), &amp; movies.</p>
